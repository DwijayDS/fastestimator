    "\n",
    "If users want to customize `TensorOp` using TensorFlow or Pytorch library, **please make sure all `TensorOp` in the `Network` need to be backend-consistent**. This means they cannot have `TensorOps` built from TensorFlow and Pytorch in the same `Network`. `ModelOps`'s backend is determined by which library the model function uses.
